arenadata_password_check
========================

Development
-----------

arenadata_password_check is a fork of passwordcheck, contrib module to check
a password quality using a fork of Greenplum/Greengage core.

There are two ways to compile and install the code:
1) Copy it as contrib/arenadata_password_check in Greenplum/Greengage code and use the
following command:
make install
2) Include PostgreSQL libraries in LD_LIBRARY_PATH and use the following
command:
make USE_PGXS=1
make USE_PGXS=1 install

Regression tests can be run as follows:
1) Module copied in contrib of Greenplum/Greengage:
make check
make installcheck # Run on existing server
2) Module managed independently, needs a server already running.
make installcheck USE_PGXS=1 # Run on existing server

In order to install it, install the library to server, add the following
parameter value to postgresql.conf and restart server.

gpconfig -c shared_preload_libraries -v '[other libraries], arenadata_password_check'

Features
--------

This module strengthens the minimum password requirement it should have
at creation with a user-defined policy:
- arenadata_password_check.special_chars, to define a list of special characters
  with the password needing at least one. Default is "!@#$%^&*()_+{}|<>?=".
- arenadata_password_check.restrict_lower, to enforce the use of at least one
  lower-case character.
- arenadata_password_check.restrict_upper, to enforce the use of at least one
  upper-case character.
- arenadata_password_check.restrict_numbers, to enforce the use of at least
  one number.
- arenadata_password_check.restrict_special, to enforce the use of at least
  one special character listed in \"arenadata_password_check.special_chars\".
- arenadata_password_check.minimum_length, minimum length of password allowed.
  Default is 8, which likely sucks.
- arenadata_password_check.maximum_length, maximum length of password allowed.
  Default is 15, which definitely sucks, but it is useful for tests.
